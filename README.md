# LSS Webhook Notifier

A Tampermonkey script that monitors the Leitstellenspiel game interface and sends notifications to Discord via webhook for various events.

## Features

- üîî Real-time event detection for:
  - New missions
  - Speaking requests
  - Incomplete missions
  - Special requirements (NEF, RTH, LNA, etc.)
  - Mission changes
  - Large missions
  - Patient transports (optional)

  - Event categories and colors
  - Patient transport filtering

## Technical Implementation

### Event Detection
The script uses MutationObserver to monitor changes in the game interface:
- Mission list changes
- Vehicle status updates
- Speaking request indicators
- Mission status changes

### Security
- Webhook URLs are encrypted using AES-GCM (256-bit)
- Encryption key is derived from the user ID using PBKDF2
- All data is stored securely in Supabase with row-level security
- No external authentication required

### Data Flow
1. Game events are detected by observers
2. Event data is formatted into Discord embeds
3. Settings are loaded from Supabase
4. Notifications are sent via webhook
5. Settings are saved back to Supabase when changed
